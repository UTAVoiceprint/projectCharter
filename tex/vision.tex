Online retailers spend tens of billions of dollars on shipping costs every year. For example, "In 2017, Amazon spent \$21.7 billion on shipping costs," it said in its most recent annual report, "nearly double the amount it spent in 2015," (Semuels). These costs will only rise in the future as customers order more products online and shipping employees demand higher wages. Most of the items that Amazon ships are small and are made out of plastic or contain plastic. If customers could print some of these items at home, it would eliminate shipping costs for them. However, the user interface of the current generation of 3D printers is not user-friendly enough for non-technical users to use 3D printing as a regular part of their everyday lives.
