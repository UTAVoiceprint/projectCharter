The inspiration for VoicePrint began long ago. One of its creators grew up watching \textit{Star Trek: The Next Generation}. On this television program, there is a device called the Replicator. When users speak to the ship's computer, the Replicator executes their commands and creates the three-dimensional object that they requested. During the summer of 2018, this team member decided to make a simpler version of the Replicator in real-life. It would be a smartphone app that would take speech input from the user, send commands to a 3D printer, and print 3D objects. This developer watched YouTube videos about 3D printing and voice commands, and he built Android apps in Java.

In the fall, a team formed around this idea. Our team has four computer science majors. Our diverse team combines experience with mobile app development, Java programming, and software engineering, with seven years of project management experience in industry. \textit{VoicePrint} has been approved, and the work has begun in earnest.
