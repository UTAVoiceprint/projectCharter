The primary stakeholders of the VoicePrint project are the end users who will use this software to print physical objects. Additional stakeholders are the development team members creating the application. There is no sponsor or immediate customer, initially the dev team is the only stakeholder.
The development team consists of five members:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Brian Leonard
    \item Kamal Mistry
    \item Quy Pham
    \item Peter Severynen
    \item William Wallace
\end{itemize}
Each member of the team is in the Computer Science Engineering field, and each will assist with the actual programming. The additional roles will start as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Product Owner: Peter Severynen
  \item Scrum Master: Brian Leonard
\end{itemize}
The Product Owner role will remain with Peter, as the project was originally his idea. This allows a single point of escalation with regards to design decisions, which removes development obstacles before they arise.
The Scrum Master role will rotate with each sprint. Brian has previous project management experience and will take charge of the first sprint, and each member will have a turn in later iterations.
