\textit{VoicePrint} is an app that controls a 3D printer using voice commands. A user selects the pattern of an object and then speaks to the phone in order to set the 3D printer's settings. \textit{VoicePrint} transcribes this speech input, parses it, and translates it into commands that can be sent to the 3D printer's control software.
