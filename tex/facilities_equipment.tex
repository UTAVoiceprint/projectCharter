Since this project is more software-oriented, neither lab space nor a testing ground is required. However, we will need to borrow a 3D printer in the senior design lab for testing. The Raspberry Pi connected to the 3D printer will also be used to interface with the printer using OctoPrint. We will also need to purchase filament in order to use the 3D printers and print objects from our app. Additional equipment may include Alexa, Amazon's voice assistant, and Google Home. This equipment will be used only if we decide to implement these services in our app. Finally, to test our app we will need an Android phone running Jellybean 5.5 or later. Anything that is not present in the lab but is required for the project will be purchased using our given budget from the CSE department.
