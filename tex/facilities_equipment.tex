Since this project is more software oriented, a lab space or testing ground is not required. However, we will need to borrow a 3D printer in the senior design lab for testing. The raspberry pi connected to the 3D printer will also be used so we can interface with the printer using Octoprint. To use the 3D printers we will also need to purchase filament to print objects from our app. Additional equipment would include Alexa, amazon's voice assistant, and Google Home. This equipment will be used if we decide to implement these devices into our app. Finally, to test our app we will need an Android phone running on at least jellybean 5.5 (OS). Everything not present in the lab like the 3D printer and raspberry pi will be purchased using our given budget from the CSE department.
